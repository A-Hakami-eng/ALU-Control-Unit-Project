# ALU & Control Unit Design using Logisim

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** and a **Control Unit (CU)** as part of a simplified processor model using **Logisim Evolution**.

---

## 📌 Overview

The ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations, while the Control Unit orchestrates the execution of instructions by managing signals and timing.

This project was developed as part of the "Computer Organization and Design" course at **Umm Al-Qura University**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn how ALU and CU interact within a processor.
- Gain hands-on experience in digital circuit design and simulation.
- Understand how control signals manage data flow between processor components.

---

## 🧠 What We Built

- **ALU**: Performs basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB) and logic (AND, OR) operations.
- **Control Unit**: Generates control signals based on opcodes to drive the datapath.
- **Logisim Circuits**: Built using logic gates, multiplexers, and custom components.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution) – Digital circuit simulator.
- Digital components used: Logic Gates, Multiplexers, Arithmetic Circuits.
